## Methodology

The system integrates multiple processes and technologies to deliver real-time and reliable insights.

### Image Analysis

1. **Data Preparation & Model Training**
   - **Image Collection & Augmentation:** Gather and augment crop images to diversify the dataset.
   - **Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and enhance images.
   - **Integration & Preparation:** Consolidate images with labels.
   - **Model Training:** Fine-tune a pre-trained InceptionV3 model and utilize ensemble methods for enhanced accuracy.
   - **Model Saving:** Two models are maintainedâ€”one for disease detection and another for severity prediction.

### Environmental Factors Integration

- **Weather API:** Fetches real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) from Open-Meteo.
- **Data Fusion:** Integrates weather data with image analysis to adjust severity predictions based on environmental factors.

### Model Loading & Serving

- **Backend Initialization:** The FastAPI server loads both the disease detection and severity prediction models.
- **Processing Pipeline:** Upon receiving an image, the backend performs:
  - Disease identification via the detection model.
  - Severity prediction by combining image data and environmental parameters.

### Frontend Integration

- **User Request Handling:** The Next.js server handles image uploads and diagnosis requests.
- **Data Display:** Receives predictions from the backend and displays disease type, severity, and AI-generated treatment insights.
- **Dashboard & Library:** Offers additional resources including a library of crop diseases and treatment plans.

### User Interaction

- **Insights & Recommendations:** Provides treatment suggestions, fertilizer advice, and prevention tips through Gemini AI.
- **Interactive UI:** Enables users to engage with real-time chat features and view modals for detailed information.

### Selling Advice

- **Web Scraping:** Uses SerpAPI to collect selling advice from multiple sources.
- **Langchain Integration:** Processes and standardizes scraped data.
- **AI Recommendations:** Gemini AI formulates text-based selling advice tailored to current market conditions.

### Discussion Forums

- **Platform:** Powered by GetStream for real-time discussion and community support.
- **User Engagement:** Facilitates Q&A, community discussions, and knowledge sharing among users.
